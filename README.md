# Corona-Android-App

This android application uses the [DP3T](https://github.com/DP-3T) library for tracing and the [Trustchain](https://github.com/Tribler/kotlin-ipv8) library (by [Tribler](https://github.com/Tribler)) for sharing the exchanged rolling proximity identifiers (anonymous hash keys) over a serverless P2P network.

It features a modern approach (incomparison to the [swiss implementation](https://github.com/DP-3T/dp3t-app-android-ch)) with Kotlin, 2-way data binding, coroutines, recyclerviews etc.

This is a proof of concept of using a decentralized platform for sharing indentifier keys, this enables complete anonymization of users and should not be used as is.

It features Kotlin code which has been migrated from Java as well as illustrations and icons made by [Ubique](https://www.ubique.ch/?app=github).
